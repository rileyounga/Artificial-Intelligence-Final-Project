# Context

This repository is a copy of the final project repository from my Artificial Intellegence undergraduate course. The purpose of the project was to independently propose, research, and test the performance of a collection of AI agents on any task. I chose to compare a Q-agent and DQN-agent's performance in self play competition in the board game Santorini. A write up of my approach and results are included in `INFO 450 Final Project Report.docx`.
